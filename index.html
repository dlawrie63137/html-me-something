           <p>Maybe it's the way I was raised. You see, when I was much younger my father had a job with a small<br>
            charter airline, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Air">Capitol Air.</a> One of the perks of a career
        in the airline industry is the ability to travel for next<br>to nothing. Growing up I had the opportunity to travel to
    many places, including England, Scotland, Germany,<br>Italy, and Hawaii.
            </p>

            <p>Lucky me, my dad also had a few friends who had earned their private licenses and I was also able to<br>
            fly on smaller General Aviation aircraft, like the Cessna 150, the Cessna 172, and the Beech Bonanza, on more<br>
        than one occasion. I fell in love with flying and would jump at the chance to climb into just about any aircraft for a ride.<br>
    To this day I love to fly, be it in a major commercial jet, a regional puddle jumper, or small GA aircraft. 
            </p>

                      </figcaption>
                  </figure>

            <p>This led me to follow a career in the airline industry, first as an Avionics Technician with the Navy, then in a<br>
            similar capacity with TWA in St. Louis. With the Navy I was able to travel to several new destinations including Azores,<br>
        Rota, Spain, Sicily, Crete, Israel, Bahrain, Halifax, Nova Scotia, and Puerto Rico. I was stationed at VRC-40 in Norfolk<br>
    working on the Grumman C-2A(R).

                  <figcaption><h5>The Grumman C-2A(R) aircraft with VRC-40 logo</h5></figcaption>
             </figure>

             <p>I'm always amazed that the larger jets are able to get off the ground. I remember when I was in Bahrain with<br>
             the Navy, our workspace was only a couple hundred yards from the end of the runway. I would watch as the Gulf Air<br>
            747s would start to slowly lumber down the runway and I would think to myself, "There's no way that something that big<br>
    is going to get off the ground, it can barely even get moving!" Without fail, by the opposite end it would be airborne.
            </p>

            <p>These days I don't get many opportunities to fly anymore. My short career in the airline industry ended with the sale<br>
            of TWA to American Airlines in early 2001, followed by the 9/11 attacks later that year. So to scratch the aviation itch<br>
        I live it vicariously through the many airshow pilots that tour the country each year.
            </p>

            <p>My favorite airshow performers (and maybe everybody else's also) are the Blue Angels. The Blue Angels are the United<br>
                 States Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron, and are arguably among the best pilots in the world. I've had the pleasure<br>
                of seeing their performances several times now in shows in St. Louis, Cape Girardeau, Davenport, Iowa and Ypsilanti, Mi.
            </p>

            </figure>

            <p>You'll find more than just military jets at your local airshow, though. Performers include everything from old Stearman<br>
            bi-planes and World War I replica aircraft to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breitling_Jet_Team">Breitling FlightDemonstration Team.</a>
            And let's be honest... this looks like it would be fun to try, right?

            <p>So if any of this has your interest piqued may I suggest a visit to one of my favorite web sites...<a href="http://www.airshows.com/">The Airshows Database Page</a><br>
            lists information for airshows all year long!
